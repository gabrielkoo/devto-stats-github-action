## üõ† Usage

Generate custom graphs with different metrics and color schemes:

```bash
# Activity graphs (GitHub-style contribution graphs)
python3 generate_advanced_graph.py --metric views --color github
python3 generate_advanced_graph.py --metric reactions --color purple
python3 generate_advanced_graph.py --metric comments --color blue
python3 generate_advanced_graph.py --metric combined --color orange

# Top articles graphs
python3 generate_top_articles.py --metric views --count 3
python3 generate_top_articles.py --metric reactions --count 5
```

**Activity graph options:**
- `--metric`: views, comments, reactions, combined
- `--color`: github, blue, purple, orange
- `--output`: custom filename
- `--no-stats`: hide statistics

**Top articles options:**
- `--metric`: views, reactions
- `--count`: number of top articles to show (default: 3)
- `--output`: custom filename

**Update data:**
```bash
./fetch_stats.sh
```

## Data Structure

The application stores data in the following structure:
- `./data/articles/{id}-{slug}.json` - Individual article statistics
- `./data/account.json` - Account-wide statistics
- `./data/top_articles.json` - Top performing articles by metrics

## API Endpoints

The application uses the following dev.to API endpoints:
- `/analytics/historical` - Historical analytics data for articles
- `/analytics/referrers` - Referrer data for articles
- `/articles/me/published` - List of published articles
- `/articles/{username}/{slug}` - Individual article details

## Procedures

1. List all published articles of the API key's user
2. For each article,
   - If it has been processed before (i.e. ./data/articles/{slug}.json exists), locate the 2nd last date in "breakdown", use the analytics and referrer APIs to update the `.breakdown` array with the new data.
   - If it has not been processed before, create a new file with the article's ID and slug, and fetch the analytics and referrer data to populate the file. Start from the day when the article was published.
3. Update the `./data/account.json` file with the total statistics of the user.

## Setup

### Local Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your dev.to API key
2. Run `python fetch_stats.py` to collect your article data
3. Generate visualizations with the Python scripts above
